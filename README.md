# Text-to-Image-Genrator-
A Text-to-Image Generator is an AI system that converts natural language descriptions (text prompts) into corresponding visual images. These models leverage deep learning techniques, particularly diffusion models or generative adversarial networks (GANs), to synthesize high-quality images from textual input.
